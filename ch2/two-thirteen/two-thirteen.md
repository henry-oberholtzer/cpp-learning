# Designing programs

- Define the goal of the program
- Define Requirements
  - Constraints the solution needs to follow
  - Capabilities the program must have to meet user's needs
  - Focused on "what" and not "how
- Define tools, targets, backup plans
  - Picking architecture
  - Tools to use
  - Testing/feedback/release strategy
- Break hard problems into simpler problems
  - Keep splitting to subtasks that are easier to solve
  - Take simple tasks and group them by similarities
- Figure out sequence of tasks

- Implementation
  - Outlining main functions
  - Implement each function
    - Define prototype (inputs & outputs)
    - Write the function
    - Test the function
- Final testing

- Keep it simple, add features over time
- Focus on one area at a time
- Test code as it goes
- Optimize the code to be maintained
